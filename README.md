HOW TO CLONE THE REPO

In order two successfully connect the two databases in the repo locally you will have to create 2 .env. files and add them to the main directory.

Create an .env. file named ".env.development" with the following code inside "PGDATABASE=nc_games" and save it to the main directory.

Secondly create another .env. file named ".env.test" with the following code inside "PGDATABASE=nc_games_test" and again save it to the main directory.

You will now be able to run the repo locally.
